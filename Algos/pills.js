You have 20 bottles of pills. 1 bottle contains pills that weight 1.01 grams each. Every bottle
OTHER than that one bottle is filled with pills that weigh 1 gram each. The pills look identical in every way
and there's no way to feel the difference manually. The pills that weigh 1.01 grams each contain the cure

in a way to guarantee that you will find the bottle that has the right pills?

If you take one of the 1g pills, y'die
