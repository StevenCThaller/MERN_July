You have 20 bottles of pills. 1 bottle contains pills that weight 1.01 grams each. Every bottle
OTHER than that one bottle is filled with pills that weigh 1 gram each. The pills look identical in every way
and there's no way to feel the difference manually. The pills that weigh 1.01 grams each contain the cure
to COVID. You also have a scale, but it only has enough battery to weigh one time. How can you weigh these pills
in a way to guarantee that you will find the bottle that has the right pills?

If you take one of the 1g pills, y'die

ANSWER!!

Take 1 pill from bottle 1, 2 pills from bottle 2, 3 pills from bottle 3, etc., all the way through 20 pills from bottle 20.
Pile em up, and weigh the pile.
Because one bottle has pills that weigh 0.01grams more than the rest of the pills, the overall pile will have a weight ending in a decimal.

If that decimal is 0.3, the magic pills are in bottle 3. If the decimal is 0.10, the magic pills are in bottle 10.
